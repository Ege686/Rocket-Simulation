# Rocket-Simulation
Shows the case of a rocket launched with drag force is acting on it and not acting on it.

With the given variables programe will calculate the velocity, position and drag force acting on the rocket with respect to time.

It uses a numerical method to solve the dynamic equation of the rocket for the drag case (Runge Kutte Method).

First tab shows the plots with respect to time. And the second tab shows the animation of the rocket for a better grasp(for some reason in this page it doesn't show the animation. It is an static image. However in the application it not static.).
